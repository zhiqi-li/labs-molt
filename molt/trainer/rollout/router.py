"""Real vllm-router in front of the engine servers, + the rollout transport over it.

The router load-balances the engines' OpenAI API (default consistent_hash: ``x-session-id`` affinity
so a rollout's render+generate co-locate on one engine); weight sync bypasses it (NCCL to the engines). Everything the runners generate goes over HTTP through the router via
one client, ``RouterGenerateClient.generate(token_ids, sp, mm) -> (RequestOutput, off_policy_len)``:
token-in / token-out over vLLM's ``/inference/v1/generate`` (VLM images are rendered server-side
first, over ``/v1/chat/completions/render``, for their mm features). Both the StepEnvRunner and the
chat server (``_chat_server``) share it. These custom routes survive the router verbatim, unlike the
OpenAI ``/v1/*`` routes whose token_ids the router schema-strips.

``AgentRunnerActor`` is the rollout driver process running those runners against the router; the
trainer round-robins prompts across a list of them (``--rollout.num_runners``).
